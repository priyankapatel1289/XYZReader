# XYZ Reader - Material Design

This repository makes use of Android's Material Design to make the design easier to read and provides accessibility for most common features. 

The starter code from Udacity can be found at
`https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code`

The starter code includes an android project that has a main page with image and title of the story. Each item is clickable and opens the stories. The starter code works, but is not very user friendly. The text is hard to read, images are not full bleed and the toolbar does not behave properly.

This repository includes an improved version of the starter code. It makes the code accessible, easier to read and includes user friend toolbar. This was achieved by making use of Coordinator Layout.
